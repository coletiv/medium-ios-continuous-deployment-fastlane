# Notes

This repository contains a sample project called Notes, a simple application where you can add/remove/edit personal notes.

A full article is available at Medium with the name [iOS Automated Testing withÂ Fastlane](https://medium.com/coletiv-stories/ios-automated-testing-with-fastlane-8c6fb317ed6d) that introduces the tool and explains the process.
