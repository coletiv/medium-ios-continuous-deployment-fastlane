# Notes

This repository contains a sample project called Notes, a simple application where you can add/remove/edit personal notes. 

This project is used to illustrate how to do automated testing using Fastlane together with Travis CI. A full article is available at Medium with the name [iOS Continuous Deployment with Fastlane](https://medium.com/coletiv-stories/ios-continuous-deployment-with-fastlane-36892ab66cb0) that introduces the tool and explains the process.
